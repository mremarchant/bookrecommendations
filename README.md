# Books You didn't Know You Needed

Here are some of the books I have found to be the best of their genere and must haves when it comes down to content. All books mentioned can be read by anyone who seeks an adventure and an escape from their ordinary lives. From romance to young adult, these books provide a safe haven for readers all around and make for a great escape. 

All books mentioned are by no means mandatory to be read but merely a recommendation. As a fellow booknerd, I share a passion for books that I can connect to where the characters feelings are mine and yell in furstration when they mess up (a must have for any good story).
## Romance Recap

Romance is a beautiful gift in this world. As a hopeless romantic myself, romance gives a reader an escape. To be able to feel the overwhelming emotions of love, anger, confusion, and more in a world differnet from yours is an experience. A classic example of romance would be The Fault in Our Stars. It follows the story of two teenagers lviing life to the fulest despite the cruel cancer that lives in their bodies. They learn about heartbreak, living in the moment, and finding a person's one true love. A personal favorite of mines is the Bullied series. It highlights the reality of mental disorders in a twisted fate of love between the two main characters. This series not only captures the essence true love is blind, but the effect of mental disorders such as Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), anxiety, eating disorders, and more. It creates a reality like no other and a safe haven for readers struggling with any of these. Romance is not for everyone but I believe they haven't found the right book yet. I read a ton of books and not every book I read is good. However, romance gets the bad end of generes due to sterotypes **but** romance has a lot to offer.

## **Wattpad** 

Wattpad is a website desiged to allow writers to explore the realm of writting and for readers to find hidden gems. I have been a user of Wattpad since 8th grade and have nothing but good things to say about the website. For writters, it is a chance to express themselves and write novels on virutally anything. The website is widely known for its popularity in fanfictions however there is something for everyone. Any topic a reader wishes to read from, it is there and it gives updates on the status of the novels. For example, as a reader, I prefer completed stories, unless the story is worth waiting for updates, from within two years and categories such as romance, young adult, and love. The website even showcases novels on topics such as diversity, representation, politics, etc. Recently, Wattpad has updated so that certain stories have to be paid for to read them which promotes the writers work. Some widely known films were once Wattpad novels before becoming novles on shelves such as The Kissing Booth and After. Wattpad, despite the stigma, is a great place to escape with stories ranging from love to teen fiction and even though many great stroies I have read in the past have become paid stories, I am proud the authors have gotten far. The Bullied series mentioned in the romance recap was also a series that started on Wattpad and all three books were published as of August 2020.
